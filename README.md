# JWT Pentest Studio

JWT Pentest Studio is a planned web application for inspecting and attacking JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It brings together a browser-based UI and supporting backend services to decode, modify and brute-force JWTs.

## Features (from `Instructions.md`)

- Decode and encode arbitrary JWTs in the browser with live editing.
- Verify signatures using a user-provided secret or public key.
- "Crack JWT" mode powered by the `jwttool` CLI to brute-force secrets.
- Token forging: switch `alg`, adjust claims and re-sign tokens.
- Default wordlist support if none is provided when cracking tokens.
- React or Vue frontâ€‘end styled with Tailwind CSS.
- Node/Express or FastAPI backend exposing verification and cracking endpoints.
- Docker Compose layout with services for the frontend, API and `jwttool` worker.
- UI modelled after JWT.io with copy buttons, a cracking section and dark/light theme.
- Automated tests covering core features.

## Setup

These instructions assume you have Docker and Node or Python tooling installed.

### Docker Compose (once provided)

```
docker compose build
```

This builds the frontend, backend and worker images. After building:

```
docker compose up
```

The services will start on a shared network and can be accessed via the defined ports.

### Building without Docker

```
# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# Backend (FastAPI example)
cd ../backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Running tests

Run frontend tests with your package manager (for example, using npm):

```
cd frontend
npm test
```

Run backend tests with pytest:

```
cd backend
pytest
```

Further instructions will be added alongside the codebase and Docker configuration.
