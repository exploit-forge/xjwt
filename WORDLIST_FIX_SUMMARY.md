# JWT Wordlist Upload Fix

## Problem Identified
The JWT pentesting tool had a critical bug where **user-uploaded wordlists were completely ignored**. Even when users uploaded custom wordlist files, the application would always fall back to using the built-in default wordlist.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Frontend Issue (CrackSection.jsx)
- ✅ **File upload UI was present** - Users could select wordlist files
- ❌ **File content was never sent** - The `wordlistFile` state was set but never used in API calls
- ❌ **Only token was transmitted** - API calls only included the JWT token, not the wordlist content

### Backend Issue (index.js)
- ✅ **Wordlist parameter was accepted** - Backend had logic to handle optional wordlist parameter
- ❌ **Parameter was always undefined** - Since frontend never sent it, this parameter was never used

### Worker Issue (worker.py)
- ✅ **Fallback logic existed** - Worker correctly fell back to default wordlist when no custom wordlist provided
- ❌ **Custom wordlist was never received** - Due to frontend/backend issues, custom wordlists never reached the worker

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Frontend Changes (CrackSection.jsx)
```javascript
// NEW: Read wordlist file content
if (wordlistFile) {
  setProgress('📖 Reading wordlist file...')
  wordlistContent = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const reader = new FileReader()
    reader.onload = (e) => resolve(e.target.result)
    reader.onerror = (e) => reject(new Error('Failed to read wordlist file'))
    reader.readAsText(wordlistFile)
  })
}

// NEW: Include wordlist content in request
const requestData = { token }
if (wordlistContent) {
  requestData.wordlist = wordlistContent
}
```

### 2. Worker Changes (worker.py)
```python
# NEW: Handle wordlist content by creating temporary files
if req.wordlist and req.wordlist.strip():
    # Create a temporary file for the custom wordlist
    temp_wordlist = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode='w', delete=False, suffix='.txt')
    temp_wordlist.write(req.wordlist)
    temp_wordlist.flush()
    temp_wordlist.close()
    wordlist_path = temp_wordlist.name
    
    # Log custom wordlist usage
    await client.post(f"{BACKEND_URL}/worker/results", 
                    json={"line": f"Using custom wordlist with {len(req.wordlist.splitlines())} entries"})
```

### 3. Backend Changes (index.js)
- ✅ **Enhanced CORS headers** for better SSE support
- ✅ **Improved error handling** for wordlist processing
- ✅ **Increased payload size limit** from 100KB to 50MB for large wordlists

### 4. Additional Improvements
- ✅ **File size validation** in frontend (warns at 10MB, rejects at 50MB)
- ✅ **User confirmation** for large wordlists to prevent accidental uploads
- ✅ **Better error handling** for oversized files
- ✅ **Enhanced status reporting** - Attack Status now shows custom wordlist usage
- ✅ **Custom wordlist detection** - Status updates when custom wordlists are detected
- ✅ **Success message differentiation** - Different messages for custom vs default wordlist success

## Testing the Fix

### Test Files Created
1. **test_wordlist.txt** - Sample wordlist with custom entries
2. **test_wordlist_fix.js** - Test script to generate test JWT tokens

### Test Procedure
1. Start application: `docker-compose up`
2. Create JWT token signed with "custom_key" (not in default wordlist)
3. Test WITHOUT wordlist upload - should fail to find secret
4. Test WITH wordlist upload - should successfully find "custom_key"
5. Verify logs show "Using custom wordlist with X entries"

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Without Custom Wordlist
- ✅ Uses default wordlist (100+ common secrets)
- ✅ Logs: "Using default wordlist with 100+ common secrets"

### With Custom Wordlist
- ✅ Uses uploaded wordlist content
- ✅ Logs: "Using custom wordlist with X entries" (where X = number of lines)
- ✅ Creates temporary file from wordlist content
- ✅ Cleans up temporary file after processing

## Key Improvements
1. **Functional wordlist uploads** - Custom wordlists are now actually used
2. **Better user feedback** - Clear logging shows which wordlist is being used
3. **Proper file handling** - Temporary files are created and cleaned up properly
4. **Backward compatibility** - Default behavior unchanged when no wordlist uploaded
5. **Error handling** - Graceful handling of file read errors and cleanup failures

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/CrackSection.jsx` - Added file reading and content transmission
- `worker/worker.py` - Added temporary file creation and wordlist content handling
- `backend/index.js` - Enhanced SSE headers and error handling

The fix ensures that user-uploaded wordlists are properly processed and used for JWT cracking attacks, resolving the critical functionality gap.
